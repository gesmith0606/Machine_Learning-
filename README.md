# Resampling 
Balanced accuracy is defined as the average of the proportion corrects of each class individually. The model that has the best-balanced accuracy score is the combination Sampling Model. The Combination Sampling model has a balanced accuracy score of .68 compared to the scores of the under-sampling model with a score of .52, the SMOTE oversampling model with a score of .62, and the Naïve Random Oversampling Model with a score of .65. 
Recall score is defined as the fraction of the total amount of relevant instances that were actually retrieved. The model that has the best recall score is the SMOTE Oversampling model with an average F1 score of .79. This is compared to the Naïve Random Oversampling model with a score of .75, the Under Sampling Model with a score .56, and the Combination sampling model with a score of .68. 
The model that has the best geometric mean score is the Combination Sampling Model.The Native Oversampling model has an average geo score of .68. This is compared to the Smote Oversampling with an average geo score of  .62, the Undersampling Model with a score of .56, and Naive Oversampling Model with a score of .65. 
# Ensemble Learning 
The model with the best balanced accuracy score is the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier with a balanced accuracy score of .93, compared to the Balanced Random Forest Classifier with a balanced accuracy score of .79.
The model with the best recall score is the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier with a average f1 score of .97 compared to the Balanced Random Forest Classifier with an average f1 score of .94.
The model with the best Geometric Mean score is the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier with an average geo score of .93 compared to the Balanced random Forest Classifier with an average geo score of .78. 
The top three features are total_rec_prncp, total_pymnt_inv, total_pymt.
